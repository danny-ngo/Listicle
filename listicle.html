          </p>

          <p class="item-text">When's the last time you've had an Italian soda?
            It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend for a
            non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the
            combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas
            are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored
            carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in
            them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven't tried), which makes it
            a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're feeling a
            refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.</p>

          <p class="item-text"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Raspberry Italian soda</p>

            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/3jHRC2umZCy">456 Cambridge Ave, Palo Alto, CA</a>
          </p>

          <p class="item-text">When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop
            Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge Avenue. The menu
            is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the
            menu -- no bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is fresh,
            the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and delicious! They have
            little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect
            snack-size portions. There's not too much seating, but there's a cute
            outdoor area in the back for warmer days.</p>

          <p class="item-text">Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the
            Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the 1050A to California and El
            Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total from the
            Gates Computer Science Building!)</p>

          <p class="item-text"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Classic Milk Tea
            with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.</p>

          </p>

          <p class="item-text">I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly
            amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only place I've
            ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I
            know what a Vanilla Bean Latte is supposed to taste like. What I do
            know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was delicious.</p>

          <p class="item-text"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Vanilla Bean latte</p>

          <p class="item-text">Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into
            its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this fresh
            and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe
            has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny
            day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and maybe
            a burrito.</p>

          <p class="item-text"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Agua Fresca</p>
